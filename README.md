# Botcord
Botcord is a visual representation of OAuth applications in Discord, helps you see how healthy your bot is doing.
(NOTE! User tokens MAY have some significant issues, I've only focused on bot accounts for now)

NOTE: You can host it at any web host, that supports html, css and js files.

Also, to the Discord Developers, if you don't feel comfromtable with the stylesheet usen, feel free to contact me, I'll take it down upon request.
